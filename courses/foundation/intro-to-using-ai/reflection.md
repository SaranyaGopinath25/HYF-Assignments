Part 2 : Reflection
--------------------

1. Identify and share 3 new things you learned from AI in the above task.

    a.  I learnt about using different models for the same prompts and get the one model that exactly suits well for the prompt to get the crisp and exact outcome we need instead of overthinking and flood us with unwanted stuffs.

    b. Earlier I have used only those code completion and Ask mode to some of the questions when I'm stuck up in my projects, but this time in this task I completely used the Agent mode that was great making changes to multiple files, creating, modifying files in our entire project.

    c. On top of using all the models and playing around different prompts to do a task, I just found the right way of prompting by being more specific and detail to get what we need exactly.
    This also gives us a clear idea about the requirement before we start to code.

2. Where did you have to tweak or correct Copilot’s suggestions to suit your needs?

    Before blindly accepting the suggestions given by Copilot, just review the code to understand the logic and test the functionalities and tweak the way we want to be done by refining with specific prompts.

3. How would you explain the difference between using Copilot to generate code for you vs. using it as an effective learning partner?

    a. Using Co-pilot to generate code : It's like using Co-pilot do speed up our work by making it to complete the boilerplate code, repetitive tasks like setting timeinterval, etc, refactoring the code. 
    Co-pilot is like do-er and we are the reviewer.

    b. Using as learning partner : Helping in completing the complex functions, so that we could understand the logic, learn and get mastered. Guiding with best practices for clean code.
    Co-pilot is like a mentor and we are a student.

4. Identify 3 risks of relying too much on AI tools when learning at HackYourFuture.

    a. This completely hindered the older way of just searching for solutions in documentations,  stackoverflow, and other kind of learnings. Even the readings are minimized depending too much on the Co-pilot's solution.

    b. Using AI significantly speed up the process and in order to meet the deadlines, there are chances of missing to understand the logic. This kind of AI usage may have the high probability of introducing bugs or even break the existing code.

    c. Eventually replacing all our works with AI will kill our analytical thinking and creativity.
