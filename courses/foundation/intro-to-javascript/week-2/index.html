    <h1>Week 2 - Intro to JavaScript</h1>

    <ul>
        <ol>
            <h3>Flight booking fullname function</h3>
            <p>
                When a user books a flight they write their firstName and surname, but when the ticket is printed a fullname should be displayed. It is our responsibility to create that.
            </p>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>Formal fullname</h3>
            <p>On the flight website the user has the possibility to check a checkbox that indicates if the user wants to be addressed formally. Let's also change getFullName to include support for formal name.</p>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>Event application</h3>
            <p>You specify how many days from today an event is being held. The function then figures out what weekday the event is being held. Here is an example:

Today is Sunday and the event is in 5 days. Therefore the event will be held on a Friday.</p>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>Weather wear</h3>
            <p>Create a function (that you have to name) that has temperature as parameter. Based on the temperature it should return a string with what the user should wear. You decide what the user should wear based on the temperature.</p>
            <code style="color:blue; ">
                const clothesToWear = youCreateThisFunctionName(18); <br>
                console.log(clothesToWear); // Logs out: "shorts and a t-shirt"
            </code>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>Student manager</h3>
            <p>For this exercise you need to figure out how Array.push works. Learn about the concept by researching about it.</p>
        </ol>
        <ol>
            <h3>Candy helper</h3>
            <p>We are at the candy store. We have taken some shovels of the caramel-strawberry-cola-lemon-gravy wine gums, a few of the banana chocolate diesel-motors and a handful of the salmon-potato covered toffee encrusted pizzas. But what is all this worth? And can you even afford it?</p>
        </ol>
    </ul>
